# HerolteVibrations
Workaround App that sets the vibration intensity on lineageOS 14.1 herolte devices (Samsung Galaxy S7) - **requires root access**.

LineageOS currently provides not vibration intensity setting for herolte devices. This App uses root access to directly write a custom value.

This app is in a early development stage. Changes made to the vibration intensity setting are currently not permanent. After each reboot they need to be set again.

A current build can be downloaded from the file list or through [this link](https://github.com/plan5/HerolteVibrations/blob/master/app-release.apk?raw=true)
