# HerolteVibrations
Workaround App that sets the vibration intensity on lineageOS herolte devices (Samsung Galaxy S7) - requires root acces.

LineageOS currently provides not vibration intensity setting for herolte devices. This App uses root access to directly write a custom value.

This app is in a early development stage. Changes made to the vibration intensity setting are currently not permanent. After each reboot they need to be set again.
